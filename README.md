# Allegro Purchases

Since there is no official API for Allegro, this is a simple Chrome extension that will allow you to download/view your purchases from Allegro. 

Please Note: it reads DOM from https://allegro.pl/moje-allegro/zakupy/kupione. And if you need older purchases, you need to scroll down to load more.

## Installation

1. Download the repository
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable Developer mode
4. Click on `Load unpacked` and select the folder with the repository
